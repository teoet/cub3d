## Introduction

Cub3D is a raycasting game written in C.
Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map. Back when computers were slower it wasn't possible to run real 3D engines in realtime,
and raycasting was the first solution. Raycasting can go very fast, because only a calculation has to be done for every vertical line of the screen. 
The most well known game that used this technique, is of course Wolfenstein 3D.

Raycasting is not the same as raytracing! Raycasting is a fast semi-3D technique that works in realtime even on 4MHz graphical calculators, 
while raytracing is a realistic rendering technique that supports reflections and shadows in true 3D scenes, and only recently computers became fast
enough to do it in realtime for reasonably high resolutions and complex scenes.
